This project is made by Arin Kulkarni , BM22BTECH11003.
The project name is-"BLOGOPEDIA" , a blog site made using Reactjs, Tailwind CSS for frontend part & a new technology(probably) on the backend-Strapi CMS.
The project is yet to be complete , as most of the buttons are static and dont work. 
Designing & making this was huge task , as I too did not have much idea about using Strapi CMS for backend , as I had less time to make this project happen , so leaving me to learn something fast & new , instead of MERN stack , which would have took time to learn MongoDB & express.

There will be some implementations done to the site , before the interview starts. The changes are as follows-
        1-More blog cards to be added. Currently there are 2 blog cards.
        2-There are very minute problems happening in the fetching of the cover image on home page , as both the cover images are the same , resolving that issue , so that it becomes dynamic as              only the cover image is not fetched properly from the backend.
        3-When cards are opened , I face a small issue in fetching the data from backend , so that will be resolved.
        (The problem is of backend as the technology used is new and had to face a lot of errors while making it possible)


The above changes will be done mostly to enhance the blog site to its fullest. 
Also , developing the site with lot more functionalities will be a goal to make it public as well.For eg- including feedback google form(may be done until the interviews scheduled), About section, Subscribing to the newsletter section, and many more.

This project is made by Arin Kulkarni , BM22BTECH11003.
The project name is-"BLOGOPEDIA" , a blog site made using Reactjs, Tailwind CSS for frontend part & a new technology(probably) on the backend-Strapi CMS.
The project is yet to be complete , as most of the buttons are static and dont work. 
Designing & making this was huge task , as I too did not have much idea about using Strapi CMS for backend , as I had less time to make this project happen , so leaving me to learn something fast & new , instead of MERN stack , which would have took time to learn MongoDB & express.
